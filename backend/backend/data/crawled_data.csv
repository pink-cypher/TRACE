2,"Example Domains As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761, a
number of domains such as example.com and example.org are maintained
for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative
examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are not
available for registration or transfer. We provide a web service on the example domain hosts to provide basic
information on the purpose of the domain. These web services are
provided as best effort, but are not designed to support production
applications. While incidental traffic for incorrectly configured
applications is expected, please do not design applications that require
the example domains to have operating HTTP service. Further Reading The IANA functions coordinate the Internetâ€™s globally unique identifiers, and
                are provided by Public Technical Identifiers, an affiliate of
                ICANN.",https://www.iana.org/domains/example
